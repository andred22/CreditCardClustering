# Credit Card Customer Segmentation With K-Means Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project was a simple exercise in clustering utilizing the K-means algorithm. The focus was on segmenting a credit card company's clients into distinct groups, enabling the development of tailored business strategies that address each customer segment's specific needs and behaviors. This was initially a project from a machine learning course.

## Project Contents

**Environment Set-Up and Data Acquisition**: Downloaded the dataset and imported necessary libraries.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted descriptive statistics and created visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

**Feature Engineering**: Converted categorical variables to numeric through mapping and one-hot encoding.

**Data Scaling**: Since K-means relies on Euclidean distance between points, all data needed to be scaled to the same range to ensure that each feature had an equal impact on the results. Utilized scikit-learn standard scaler for this operation.

**Selecting Optimal Cluster Value**: Calculated inertia for various values of K and plotted the decrease in inertia. Applied the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters based on where the rate of inertia reduction slowed significantly.

**Analyzing Results**: Examined the data grouped by cluster and used the insights to provide practical business recommendations tailored to each customer segment.
